#DocBook with Eclipse#

This small project is just an article on getting set-up to use
DocBook with an Eclipse environment.  My preliminary outline is

1. Introduction
2. Getting Files
3. Installing Files
4. Configuring Eclipse
5. DocBook Starter Kit
6. Tips and Tricks

I also plan to add a "Starter Kit" with templates and samples for

* Customization Layers
* Build Scripts
* XML/XSL Eclipse code templates
