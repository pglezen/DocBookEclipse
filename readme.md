#DocBook with Eclipse#

This small project is just an article on using DocBook
with an Eclipse environment.  There are two folders,
each one is an Eclpse 4.2 project.

* `DocBook` - The source code for the document.
* `StarterKit` - A starter kit for new DocBook workspaces and projects.

The latest rendering of the source can be viewed on the 
[GitHub Pages sister site](http://pglezen.github.com/DocBookEclipse).
