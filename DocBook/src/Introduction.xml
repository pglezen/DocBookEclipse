For this version of the article, I'm going to assume you have some reason to
learn DocBook rather than try to provide a motivation.  But just in case you
stumbled on this document expecting an office suite replacement for products
such as MS-Office, OpenOffice or LibreOffice, stop now.  DocBook is not a
WYSIWYG product.  It has a considerable learning curve and should only be
used by propeller-heads.
