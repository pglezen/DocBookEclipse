I configure the DocBook related stylesheets in
<filename class="directory">/usr/local/share</filename>.  One must
have admin rights to set up here.  If you don't have admin
privileges, you may follow these steps substituting a location
under your user directory.
</para>
<procedure>
<step>
   <para>
   Expand the DocBook stylesheets into 
   <filename class="directory">/usr/local/share</filename>.
   The name of the directory created by expanding the archive should
   contain the version number of the stylesheets.
   </para>
</step>
<step>
  <para>
  Create a soft link named 
  <filename class="directory">docbook</filename> 
  that points to the directory just
  created by expanding the archive.
  </para>

    <command>ln -s docbook-xml-ns-1.77.1 docbook</command>

  <para>
  Afterward, your directory should look similar to this.
  </para>
  <screen>
  /usr/local/share$ ls -l

  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    21 Jun  6 21:18 docbook@ -> docbook-xsl-ns-1.77.1

  </screen>
</step>
<step>
  <para>
  Expand the FOP and OFFO archives into the
  <filename class="directory">/usr/local/share/java</filename>
  directory.  For the FOP directory, create a soft link as was
  done in the previous step.  This is not necessary for the
  OFFO distribution since we are simply poaching its library,
  not referencing it.  The
  <filename class="directory">/usr/local/share/java</filename>
  directory should look similar to this.
  <screen>
/usr/local/share/java$ ls -l

  </screen>
  </para>
</step>
<step>
  <para>
  Copy <filename>fop-hyph.jar</filename> from the OFFO installation
  to the <filename class="directory">fop/lib</filename> directory.
  (Or you can simply hard link to it.) 
  </para>
</step>
</procedure>
This completes the file system set-up for Mac OS X.
